# About Me
Originally from India, I am now based in **Ontario, Canada**. I pursued a degree in Computer engineering to understand better how computers work. I later joined an IT company to learn how things are built online. Eventually, I transitioned to working at the intersection of design and engineering, following my passion. I later realized design was my true calling, which led me to focus on UX and UI to merge creativity with technology.

I excel at creating digital solutions by leveraging cutting-edge technologies, frameworks, and methodologies to develop human-centered designs. My expertise lies in conducting user research, designing intuitive interfaces, and turning product ideas into engaging, interactive prototypes.

Design empowers me to express the change I want to see in the world â€” and work with people and teams attempting to do the same.
