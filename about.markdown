As a post-graduate student with a bachelor’s degree in computer science, my journey into the world of programming and design has been anything but conventional. During my undergraduate studies, I found myself disengaged from programming, despite the technical foundation I was building. It wasn’t until I discovered UX design that I truly felt a spark of passion for creating meaningful digital experiences. I began teaching myself UX principles and methodologies, which eventually led me to my first role as a UX Designer/Developer. In this role, I had the opportunity to design intuitive interfaces and witness them come to life through code, sparking a newfound appreciation for the synergy between design and development.

This experience inspired me to revisit programming with a fresh perspective and a deeper sense of purpose. Determined to expand my skill set and bring my ideas to life independently, I enrolled in the Web Development program at **Humber Polytechnic**. Since then, programming has become more than just a career path—it’s a passion and a hobby that I eagerly pursue. I’ve developed a strong appreciation for problem-solving, attention to detail, and the ability to adapt to new technologies—qualities I believe are essential for any software engineer.

Today, I am driven by the desire to create seamless, user-centered applications that not only function flawlessly but also deliver exceptional experiences. My unique background in both design and development allows me to approach challenges with a holistic mindset, ensuring that every project I work on is both technically robust and visually compelling. I am excited to continue growing as a developer, contributing to innovative projects, and collaborating with teams that value creativity, curiosity, and a commitment to excellence.
